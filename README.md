# MBA/CPN: Model-Based Approach (MBA) with Coloured Petri Nets (CPN)  
This repository relates to a MBA used to design insulin infusion pump systems using assurance cases and CPN.

The MBA/CPN (https://github.com/alvarosobrinho/mbacpn/wiki) is composed of CPN reference models of insulin infusion pump systems, aiming to assist the quality assessments during the development and certification process. 

Each complete reference model is composed of modules available in the fold named modules. The models were specified using the CPN/Tools software.

The MBT/CPN tool (https://github.com/selabhvl/mbtcpn) was used to generate abstract tests from a reduced version (available in the fold named Reduced-Reference-Model) of the first system refinement.
